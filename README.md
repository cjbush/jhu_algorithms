##Programming Assignment 1:

###Files:
* AbstractTree.java
* BinaryTree.java
* TestBinaryTree.java
* Tree.java

###Project Info
* Compiler Version: JDK8
* IDE: Eclipse
* Compiling instructions: Use Eclipse project importer to import the project, then just hit run.

All changes are located in BinaryTree.java, with a few test cases added to TestBinaryTree.java


##Programming Assignment 2:
###Files:
* BucketSorter.java
* ISorter.java
* List.java
* Main.java
* MultiStack.java
###Project Info
* Compiler Version: JDK8
* IDE: NetBeans
* Compiling instructions: Open project in NetBeans and hit run. I couldn't get annotation processing working in Eclipse for some reason.

There won't be any output when you hit run. It should just say Build Successful. Everything in main is done through assertions rather than printing.

##Programming Assignment 3:
###Files: 
* AbstractGraph.java
* DirectedGraph.java
* UndirectedGraph.java
* Edge.java
* IDFS.java
* IGraph.java
* Main.java
* PartADFS.java
* PartBDFS.java
* Stack.java
* TextBookDFS.java
* Vertex.java

Just load the project in NetBeans and hit run. The DFS is verified with assertions, and the edges for part B will be printed in the console.
